           Q1) The main difference between the CSS Flexbox layout model and the CSS Grid layout model is how they handle the organization and alignment of elements within a container:
            <p>
                1)Flexbox Layout Model:
            </p>
            <p>
                Flexbox, or the Flexible Box layout model, is designed for arranging elements along a single axis (either horizontally or vertically) within a container.
            </p>
            <p>
               2) Grid Layout Model:
            </p>
            <p>
                CSS Grid is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create both rows and columns in a grid-like structure.

            Q2)
            <br>
            <br>
            1)justify-content:
            <br>

            The justify-content property controls how flex items are aligned along the main axis (the primary axis of the flex container). The main axis direction is determined by the flex-direction property.
            <br>
            2)align-items:
            <br>
            The align-items property controls how flex items are aligned along the cross-axis (the perpendicular axis to the main axis). The cross-axis direction is determined by the flex-direction property.
            <br>
            3)gap:
            <br>
            The gap property (or its individual counterparts like gap-row and gap-column) sets the spacing between flex items in a grid or flex container.
            <br>
            4)flex-direction:
            <br>
            The flex-direction property determines the direction in which flex items are laid out within the flex container.
            <br>
            5)flex-wrap:
            <br>
            The flex-wrap property controls whether flex items should wrap to the next line or remain on a single line if they overflow the container's size along the main axis.
